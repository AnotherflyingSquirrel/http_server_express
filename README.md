**An nginx-like http server built using expressJS, using the NodeJS runtime environment**

- Import Postman docs from `ExpressJS_server.postman_collection.json` to explore functionality and requests served by server
- Create a .env file in root directory to use dotenv to set port number by inserting the following text into the .env file:
  `PORT=<port number to listen on>`
- Have fun modifying the src as you wish! You can fork this repo and fetch this codebase to your work environment using git on your machine
- Thank you! this is my first time writing documentation for a project other than using Postman. If you have any advice for me in regards to anything, reach out to me on github or you can open an issue on any of my repositories. Have a good day!
